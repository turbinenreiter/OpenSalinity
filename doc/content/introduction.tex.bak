\chapter{Introduction}

65\% of the worlds energy is produced using fossil fuels []. Those fuels have to main problems: they are not renewable, meaning that the resources might be depleted one day, and they have a negative CO2-balance [], resulting in a green house effect that changes the climate of the world[].

Due to this problems, alternatives are needed. Renewable production of energy using wind or solar combined with energy storage in batteries

Given the depletion of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are growing in importance.

This photobioreactor is used to grow algae that produce lipids from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis. These lipids can be processed to biofuel and other oil-derivatives, replacing crude oil as precursor. In order to be economical viable, the reactor has to feature minimal investment and operating cost.

To better develop, compare and optimize different reactor concepts, a computational fluid dynamics model is being developed. In order to validate this model, and to generate data to feed into it, the real flow conditions in an actual reactor have to be studied.
The scope of this work is the development and test of a sensor system to make that possible.

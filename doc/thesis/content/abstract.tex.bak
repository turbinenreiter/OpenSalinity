In the light of problems surrounding the use of fossil fuels, photobioreactors emerge as a cost effective option to produce climate-neutral and renewable bio-fuels. To study and improve those reactors simulations and experiments are necessary. To enable the measurement and analysis of the flow in the reactor this thesis develops a low-cost electrical conductivity meter to measure changes of salinity in a flowing liquid. This allows for tracking saltwater pulses in a freshwater flow, indicating the movement of the volumes. The resulting system was successfully tested and generated usable data.
